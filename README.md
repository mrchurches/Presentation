HiðŸ‘‹! I'm Laureano Iglesias, from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Thank you for take the time to view my github profile.

## About me
I'm a fullstack web developer, 
       with great capacity for teamwork, great adaptability and predisposition.
During this year I studied and finished the full stack web developer bootcamp at Henry with +700 hours of practice/theory doing individual and group projects where I learned and perfected my back-end and front-end bases, with extensive use of javascript with their libraries and frameworks.

- I'm currently working on finishing my e-commerce grupal project, and other personal projects.
- I'm interested to learn Solidity (smart contracts) and more about databases
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Projects.
- Ask me about JavaScript, React, React Native, Redux, HTML, CSS, Node JS, Express, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, Sequelize, Bootstrap

### Soft skills
In addition, my experience outside the IT world is +6 years in customer service, both face-to-face and by telephone, which allows me to have excellent communication, oral and written, and a very good active listening.
